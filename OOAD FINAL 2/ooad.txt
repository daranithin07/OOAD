class diagram(structural diagram)
-types of objects and relations between them
-describes attributes and operations of a class
-analysis and design of static view of an application
-base for component and deployment diagrams
-three sections-upper-name of the class, middle-attributes and lower-methods or operations
-relations-dependency, generalisation, and association-aggregation and composition.

use-case diagram(behavioral diagram)
-functionalities of system turned into usecases
-use cases, actors and their relationships
-dynamic view of the system
-how entity from outside of system interacts with the system
-internal and external factors that influence the system

interaction diagrams-sequence and collaboration diagram
sequence diagram(behavioral diagram)
-flow of messages in the system
-dynamic view of the system
-interaction between objects in a system
-sequence can get more complex but are easy to generate
-incorrect results maybe produced, if order of flow of messages changes

collaboration diagram(behavioral diagram)
-both sequence and diagram represent same information but differently, also known as communication diagram
-potrays object architecture in the system
